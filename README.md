# SEOshop PHP API client
This package is a convenience wrapper to communicate with the SEOshop REST-API.

## Installation
For the installation of the client, there are 2 ways. The composer way is preferable, but not always possible.

### Composer
Include the package in your `composer.json` file
``` json
{
    "require": {
        "seoshop/seoshop-php": "~1.6"
    }
}
```

...then run `composer update` and load the composer autoloader:

``` php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// ...
```

### Manual
Obtain the latest version of the SEOshop PHP API client
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/SEOshop/API-PHP-Client
```

And include the class in your project
``` php
require_once '/path/to/WebshopappApiClient.php';
```

## Usage
There are a lot of API resources that are accessible through this client. You can look them up by looking at the code. Their name matches the name in the documentation.

``` php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new WebshopappApiClient('live', '[your-api-key]', '[your-api-secret]', 'en');

$shopInfo = $client->shop->get();
```
